to create rpms under storm-installer. This was git cloned from:
https://github.com/acromusashi/storm-installer

There aren't any instructions on how to create rpms. 
There are 3 rpms, storm-installer-0.8.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm, 
storm-service-0.8.1-1.el6.x64_64.rpm and storm-service-debuginfo-0.8.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm

cd into the storm-installer directory. 
copy storm-0.8.1.tgz to your rpm SOURCES directory, mine is at /home/dc/rpmbuild/SOURCES
rpmbuild -ba SPECS/storm; this creates the storm-0.8.1.rpm

To create the storm-service-0.8.1.rpm:

move directory storm-service to storm-service-0.8.1
create the tgz file for this directory and copy to /home/dc/rpmbuild/SOURCES
[dc@localhost storm-installer]$ tar -cvzf  storm-service-0.8.1.tgz storm-service-0.8.1/ 

run rpmbuild -ba filename.spec:
[dc@localhost storm-installer]$ rpmbuild -ba SPECS/storm-service.spec 
show rpms under /home/dc/rpmbuild/RPMS
[dc@localhost storm-installer]$ ls /home/dc/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
mongo-10gen-2.2.0-mongodb_1.el6.x86_64.rpm
mongo-10gen-debuginfo-2.2.0-mongodb_1.el6.x86_64.rpm
