problem with TransactioalTopologyBuilder using storm-analytics environment vs. pom.xml in storm-test4

debug simpler case here

the correct jars arent registering? 

no such method error when using integer parameters in setBolt() method of TransactionalTopologyBuilder. Works when parallelism degree is removed
